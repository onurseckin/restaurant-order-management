# Restaurant Order Management

This is a React application that simulates a restaurant order management system, similar to what might be used by Owner.com's restaurant clients.

## Features

- Display a list of restaurant orders
- Sort orders by time, price, or status
- Filter orders by status (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Mark orders as "in-progress" or "completed"
- Responsive UI with status-based styling

## Project Structure

- `src/components/OrderManagement.tsx`: Main component for order management
